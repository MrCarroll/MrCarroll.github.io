## About Me

I'm James. A lot of my free time involves computers, whether playing on them, or playing with them.
A lot of my recent projects relate to [Snap](https://snapcraft.io) packages, which I like to spend my free time helping out with where I can.
Some of my own snaps are even pretty successful, for example, [the ROOT snap](https://root.cern/blog/snap-announcement/), which is helping out thousands of university students (amongst others) worldwide!

Some of my favourite games are Team Fortress 2, Sea of Thieves, Red Dead Redemption (1 & 2), Dying Light, and I may have played more hours of RuneScape than I'd like to admit.
I'm particularly fond of multiplayer games that play well with friends.
Outside of gaming, I also like travelling to new places.
I'm also a big fan of Louis Theroux and his documentaries.
